                    <h3>Schedule and match reporting</h3>  
    
                    <p>There will be six weeks of best of two matches every Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00pm EST.  Each separate league will have a maximum of 49 teams.  If teams can come to agreement on a different time that works for BOTH teams, that would also be acceptable.  If no agreement can be made, the games will be played at 9:00 est on the proper league night. The schedule found <%= link_to "here", seasons_path%> and on your team page will outline the six week schedule before the season begins.  After the six weeks, the top ranked teams will compete in a few weeks of play-offs.</p>
