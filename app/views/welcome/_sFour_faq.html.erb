        <p>Season 4 will be using a very different format.  We'll have four separate divisions generally divided by skill level.  Each of the top three divisions will have approximately half of their slots filled by teams invited from previous seasons and the rest of the slots will be available to new or previous teams as paid slots.  Within those divisions will have groups of (ideally) 10 teams resulting in a nine week regular season.</p>
        <p>So, what's the advantage to paying, you ask?  Good question.  I'm glad you asked.  So glad that I'll almost owe you one maple bar.  Almost.  Though, I haven't been very good at paying off my maple bars, just ask <%= link_to "Lesk", "players/1808"%>.  <b>The paid slots act as accelerators.</b>  Do you think your team deserves to be at a higher level, possibly even the legendary level?  That's awesome and it's why we have the paid slots.  You don't want to pay?  Then certainly don't!  Start at our entry level division, do well, and the next season you'll be invited to one of the higher divisions. </p>
        <p>Our post season will also be handled a bit different.  We'll have four separate playoffs with prize pools starting at $500, $100, $50, then some nifty Dota 2 items.  Different divisions will have a differing number of teams progressing to these respective playoffs.  More on this below. </p>
        <p>So what happens if you're in a lower, paid division and want to jump to a higher one?  You'll just pay the difference between your current division and the division you'd like to join.</p>

        <p>This is our top level!  We view these teams to be the most competitive we have. It costs $25 for one of the paid slots in this division.  This division has a LOT to offer.  <b>We will have only a small amount of paid slots in this division!</b></p>
        <p>There will be a total of 20 teams in this division of which half will progress to the premier playoff with the $500 prize pool and the rest will go to the playoff with a $100 prize pool.  See the diagram, it explains all of this better. </p>

          <li>3. A chance at the largest prize pools</li>
          <li>4. Maybe a little bit of street cred</li>
          <li>5. Excessive Rasputin attention. I call it Rasputention.  Not to be confused with hypertension.  (I'll likely chat you nearly every day asking when you can play your game.  You're gonna love it.)</li>
