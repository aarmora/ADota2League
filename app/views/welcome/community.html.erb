        <p>In Season 4 the captain will be responsible for adding any team members to his team.  There will be no way for a player to join a team without the captain.  However, in order to be added to a team you will have to be in our system.</p>
        <p>To get into our system you'll simply need to sign in through steam!.</p>
        <p>If you are a captain and want to add a player you do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Select desired player from the "add player" section</li>

        <p>Each player on our site has their own page where they can put something about themselves in their bio, list their desired roles, their MMR and total hours played. Please use these so that teams can recruit you and you can easily recruit others.  You can sort by any of these statistics on our free agent page.  We also have a few additional pretty cool tools that you can use.</p>
        <h4>Endorsements</h4>
        <p>Each player's page has a heart right next to their name.  If you click this heart, you endorse that player as a good player or someone worth playing with.  If you enjoyed playing with a player even a little, we encourage you to endorse this person.  This doesn't necessarily mean the player is going to be professional by any means.  It's just a little something saying that someone real believes this player has value.</p>
        <h4>Comments</h4>
        <p>Comments are like one step beyond an endorsement.  If you feel that soemone was especially worthwhile, leave a comment!  This should help others know a little more about the player and their skills.  This is NOT a place for flames or criticisms.  Comments are not anonymous and if we will take further action.</p>
