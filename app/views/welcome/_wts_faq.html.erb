          <p>Casting will be provided by <a href="http://twitter.com/nahazdota" target="_blank">Nahaz</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/siractionslacks" target="_blank">Sir Actionslacks</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/toffees_dota2" target="_blank">Toffees</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/gotcowdota" target="_blank">myself</a>.

            <li>2. Best of three finals</li>
            <li>3. Side is determined by coin toss. For the finals, the second game will be a swap and the third game will be a coin toss again</li>
            <li>4. Each team will get up to three minutes of pause per game. After this point, the opposing team does not need to hold the game. Admins may call for an unpause at any time</li>
            <li>5. In the case of remakes due to lobby mistakes, the game will be remade with new heroes. In the case of remakes after the game has started (for example, due to server disconnects), the game will be remade from a save point where possible</li>
            <li>6. Any demonstrable instances of cheating (including but not limited to streamsniping, DDOS) will result in an automatic disqualification. Please show good sportsmanship</li>
            <li>7. For the integrity of the tournament, please do not stream your games unless you have at least a 4 minute delay</li>
            <li>8. No coaches</li>
            <li>9. No spectators not affiliated and approved by AD2L</li>
            <li>10. Games will start December 13th at 3:00 EST. If we have too many teams, we will make it a two-day event. Please be prepared to spend Saturday afternoon and evening (in EST) playing and possibly part of Sunday afternoon as well</li>
            <li>11. Servers will be US-East</li>
          <ol>
          <p>All AD2L conduct rules apply. Basically, don't do anything your imaginary (or real) sponsor wouldn't like.</p>

          <p>Tell your friends, make a team, and enter. The more people we have enter, the easier it is to justify getting events like this going in the future. In addition, watch and/or follow the streams at CEVO-TV to help us evaluate community interest. Tell your friends, family, pets, and neighborhood drunks to watch as well.</p>
          <p>If you want to help encourage free-to-play tournaments for the community of various types, you may consider buying an AD2L or CEVO Season 6 ticket in Dota-TV (both organizations which provide free-to-play tournaments of varying sizes). It's more important to watch than it is to buy, though.</p>
          <p>You can also contribute directly if you like tournaments like this one, AD2L has a patreon page. I am not going to take direct donations, so if you wanted to donate to me just offer that money as prize money instead. However, if you want updates on what I'm doing, including tournaments like this or general casting, writing, and projects, a follow on <a href="http://twitter.com/gotcowdota" target="_blank">twitter.com/gotcowdota</a> will get you that.</p>
