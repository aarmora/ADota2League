== Setting up this app with Heroku

Currently, TinyTDS (MSSQL Adapter) needs a special buildpack on Heroku. To get around this:
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Helabs/heroku-buildpack-ruby-freetds.git

After creating your app or setting up your existing app to use the buildpack, you need to modify the DATABASE_URL config variable to point to your sqlserver instance. We currently use a SQL Server 2008 Express edition:

heroku config:add DATABASE_URL=sqlserver://username:password@sqlserver_host:1433/database_name

Finally, we need to add the data from application.yml (our Dota2 API key and so on). Since we use Figaro (see that gem page for more info), we can simply run rake figaro:heroku, which will set all our variables on heroku
